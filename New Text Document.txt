KHAAN SAAB
 
Khaan Saab or the Royal Guest is a tribute to the rich cuisine that was normally served in the 'Durbar' of the Emperors of the North West Frontier which influenced the Mughal Cuisine to a great extent as well. The restaurant boasts of very ethnic Indian food, traditional and some even recreated and presented in their original form. This could very well be considered the USP of the restaurant. The menu is carefully crafted and a wide array of delectable spread which covers a great span from Afghan to the Deccan, succulent kebabs from the region of Samarkand to the Lucknowi Kakori and Chingari Murgh from Punjab could very well be considered the star delicacies on the menu. 
The menu also takes care of all the Vegetarian patrons by offering them the best array of carefully selected greens, vegetables and spices cooked to perfection. The beautiful ambience and warm service in the restaurant is an add on to the already exquisite menu and definitely one of its kind in the entire city of Hyderabad. So get ready for a truly Royal experience on your visit to Kaan Saab. Bon Voyage!!
